# Uno
A game of Uno that can be played in the console.

This is the first proper program I made in C#, way back in August of 2023. By default the game features three "bots" and the player, with options for increasing/decreasing bot-count.

Aside from a few tweaks, the code is as it was back when I first wrote it, including comments. Expect WTFs.
